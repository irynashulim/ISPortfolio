# Portfolio by Iryna Shulim
## Description
This is my first portfolio made from the scratch. The projects in this portfolio are examples only, I made those webpages but didnt own the projects.

A portfolio is a compilation of materials that exemplifies your beliefs, skills, qualifications, education, training and experiences. It provides insight into your personality and work ethic.
I build my Portfolio with HTML and CSS. Used flex-box for layout and added Mediua Queries to make it responsive for different screen sizes.
